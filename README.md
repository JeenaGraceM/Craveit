#### Project Description

Craveit is a user-friendly recipe-sharing platform where users can discover, create, and customize recipes based on their dietary preferences, health considerations, and ingredient availability. The website offers features like personalized recommendations, ingredient substitutions, and a seamless recipe submission interface.

#### The Problem statement

Let’s face it: cooking can sometimes feel like an overwhelming game of Tetris with ingredients, dietary restrictions, and a bunch of recipes that don’t quite match what you’re craving. You might be stuck staring into your fridge trying to figure out how to make a meal with that random bunch of veggies and half a bag of rice. Or maybe you’ve got a specific diet in mind—gluten-free, keto, or vegan—but your recipe search ends up feeling like scrolling through a never-ending Pinterest board of things you can’t even eat. Plus, every time you find a new recipe, it’s hard to keep track of it and share it with friends. We get it—cooking can be stressful, but it should be fun, right?

#### The Solution

Welcome to CraveIt—the recipe platform that’s got your back in the kitchen (and your pantry)! Want to use up the ingredients you’ve got lying around? Just input them into our easy-to-use system, and boom—recipe suggestions that are tailored just for you. Whether you're looking for healthy meals, quick fixes, or dishes that meet your specific dietary needs (hello, gluten-free and keto), CraveIt makes sure you get exactly what you're after. Missing a few ingredients? No worries! We’ll throw out some tasty alternatives so you don’t have to make an extra trip to the store. Want to share your own recipes and meal ideas? We’ve got you covered there too! CraveIt lets you store, organize, and share your culinary creations, making cooking way more fun, easy, and totally personalized. Your next favorite meal is just a click away!
